Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal
See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared
It's like we are awake here and asleep in heaven until we die, then we are asleep here and awake there
What we have once enjoyed and deeply loved we can never lose, for all that we love deeply becomes a part of us
